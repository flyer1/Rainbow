As not all of our centres provide transportation to all of the schools in the area, we do our best to transfer children to the Centre that transports to their school of choice, prior to starting Kindergarten.  When Rainbow Sage Creek opens the same process will be used to transfer children currently at our other centres, who will attend Ecole Sage Creek School, to the daycare.  Internal transfers are always based on the date the family started at Rainbow; families who have been with us the longest get priority.  After we have determined how many children are transferring, the online registry will be used to fill all remaining spaces including the new ones that will become available at other Rainbow locations.  It is important to note that Rainbow will have a total of 112 new spaces spread across 7 locations in the area once the Sage Creek Centre opens.  Families can register for any Rainbow location and we will do our best to do internal transfers when spaces become available."

            },

                "question": "Will there be transportation to Ecole Sage Creek from other Rainbow locations?",

Every effort will be made to place children attending the school at the daycare, as spaces are available.  Should your child not be placed prior to starting school it will then be the parent's responsibility to arrange transportation."
